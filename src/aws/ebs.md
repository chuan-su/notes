# EBS

![ebs](../img/aws-ebs.svg)

**Note that**
- Amazon EBS can deliver performance for workloads that require the lowest-latency access to data from a single EC2 instance. You can also increase EBS storage for up to 16TB or add new volumes for additional storage.
- You can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single instance. *The volume and instance must be in the same Availability Zone.*
- An EBS volume can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time.
- EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production which means that you can modify the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.
- RAID 0 configuration enables you to improve your storage volumes' performance by distributing the I/O across the volumes in a stripe.  
- RAID 1 configuration is used for data mirroring.

#### Snapshots Encryption

![ebs-snapshosts](../img/aws-ebs-snapshots.svg)

To copy an encrypted snapshot from one AWS Region to another, you must specify the CMK in the destination AWS Region. This is because CMKs are specific to the AWS Region that they are created in.

**Note that** Snapshots are incremental backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. This minimizes the time required to create the snapshot and saves on storage costs by not duplicating data. Each snapshot contains all of the information that is needed to restore your data (from the moment when the snapshot was taken) to a new EBS volume. 

You can enable EBS Encryption By Default feature for a AWS region in account settings.

## IOPS and Disk Throughput

AWS measures storage performance in *input/output operations per second*.

MySQL and MariaDB have a page size of 16 KB. Hence, writing 16 KB of data to disk would constitute one I/O operation.
Suppose your MySQL database needs to read 102,400 KB (100 MB) of data every second. Then the database needs to be able to read `102400 / 16 = 6400` 16 KB data, which requires your storage to be able to sustain 6400 IOPS.

Next consideration is the disk throughput - the data transfer rate.

Suppose you are running a MySQL, to sustain 2,000 Mbsp of disk throughput you need to divide the bandwidth by the page size, as follows:

```ruby
16 KB * 8 = 128 Kb
128 Kb = 0.128 Mb
2,000 Mbsp / 0.128 Mb = 15,625 IOPS
```

### General SSD Storage (gp2)

For each gigabyte of data that you allocate to a volume, RDS allocates that volume a baseline performance of three IOPS, up to a total of 16,000 IOPS per volume. 

A 20 GB volume would get 60 IOPS, whereas a 100 GB volume would get 300 IOPS. A 5,334 GB volume would get 16,000 IOPS. This means that the larger your volume, the better performance youâ€™ll get. Thus the ratio of storage in gigabytes to IOPS is `3:1`.

To achieve 2,000 Mbps disk throughput to a volume, it would need 16,000 IOPS allo- cated. Note that you must specify provisioned IOPS in increments of 1,000. Also, as stated earlier, this is the maximum number of IOPS possible with gp2. To achieve this many IOPS, your volume would have to be 5,334 GB or about 5.33 TB.

### Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)

The ratio of storage in gigabytes to IOPS must be at least `50:1`. For example, if you want 32,000 IOPS, you must provision at least 640 GB of storage.

You can provision up to 64,000 IOPS per io1 volume.
