# S3 and Glacier

 - Glacier supports archives as large as 40 TB, whereas S3 buckets have no size limit.
 - Glacier [archives](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-data-model.html) are encrypted by default, whereas encryption on S3 is an option you need to select.
 - Unlike S3’s “human-readable” key names, Glacier archives are given machine-generated IDs.

The biggest difference is the time it takes to retrieve your data. Retrieving the objects from an existing Glacier archive can take a number of hours. You can specify one of the following when initiating a job to retrieve an archive based on your access time and cost requirements:  

- **Expedited** - data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes
- **Standard** - Standard retrievals typically complete within 3–5 hours.
- **Bulk** - Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5–12 hours.
