## Amazon FSx for Lustre

Amazon FSx also integrates with Amazon S3, making it easy for you to process cloud data sets with the Lustre high-performance file system. When linked to an S3 bucket, an FSx for Lustre file system transparently presents S3 objects as files and allows you to write changed data back to S3.
